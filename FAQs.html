                                <h2>What is FCTC?</h2>
                                    <p>FCTC stands for "From Cops To Coders" This is a resource for current law enforcement officers (verification required) to have a one stop resource to start learning skills they can use to leave law enforcement. The reason why coding might be perfect for you is because you don't need a degree for it. You can learn the skills needed to become a software engineer in or around 6 months learning it part time.</p>

								<h2>How do I verify?</h2>
                                    <p>Verification is done through our Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/Ntkfq9GxHW">here.</a></p>

								<hr class="major">

								<h2>Why should I verify</h2>
                                    <p>To gain access to the Discord so that you can access the other channels and view other resources. Also get access to channels to talk mad shit.</p>

								<hr class="major">

								<h2>Can I really get a job as a coder without experience and a degree?</h2>
                                    <p><strong>No. You can't.</strong> You need to have one or the other. <strong>But</strong> if you follow the process, you will have <strong>experience</strong> and something college grads won't have.<strong>You will have paid clients, projects, portfolios and the prep you need to become a paid software engineer.</strong> Vast majority of college grads do not have these things. You will learn how to prove you know how to code, how to interview and how to game the system to get hired.</p>

                                <hr class="major">

                                <h2>What will I be learning?</h2> 
                                    <p>You will be learning how to become a software engineer and the skills needed for it. You will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React and other skills needed to think and work as a software engineer.</p>
                                        
                                <hr class="major">

                                <h2>What if I am too old?</h2>
                                    <p>No such thing. People have became software engineers in their 50s without any prior experience.</p>
                                        
                                <hr class="major">
                                        
                                <h2>So what is the price or catch?</h2>
                                    <p>Its completely free and there is no catch. We're in a unique time where there is a HUGE demand for software engineers. You can go from zero experience to hired within 6 months to a year. All it requires is your dedication. There are some paid resources you can use if you would like to help aid you along the way if you're an idiot like me.</p>
                                        
                                <hr class="major">

                                <h2>What if I am not very computer literate?</h2>
                                    <p>You will learn.</p>
                                        
                                <hr class="major">

                                <h2>What resources will we use and what do I need to pay?</h2>
                                    <p>We will use #100Devs program as Leon is a great teacher and has a great program outlined. This discord is just a place for LEOS to talk about switching out from LE to coding. Along with putting all the resources into one place. You can do this entire program without paying a single penny. However, if you're an idiot like me, you might need a little help. That is where udemy comes into play. Normally can get their classes for $20-$50 bucks</p>

								<h2>What equipment do I need?</h2>
									<p>A computer, access to the internet and the will to learn. Your Computer does not need to be anything fancy. I would avoid Chromebooks or anything similar. Use either a Windows PC or a Mac Computer. Either or. Go with your preference. Don't worry about Linux until later. Look at getting something with at least an <em>i5 // Ryzen 5 and 8GB of ram</em> This would be the minimum. Other wise go with an <em>i7 // Ryzen 7 with 16GB of ram</em> This will future proof you. If you're in the market for a new computer feel free to ask what you're looking for and what you will use it for in the &#35;general-questions channel of the Discord.</p>

								<hr class="major">

								<h2>What about the job market?</h2>
									<p>Don't worry about the Job Maket. Just go on indeed or LinkedIn and look at "Software Developer" or "Full Stack Engineer" and you will see thousands upon thousands of jobs.</p>
