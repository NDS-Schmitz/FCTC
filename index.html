                From Cops To Coders (FCTC) is a free program for current and recently former law enforcement officers to learn the skills needed to leave law enforcement and switch to software engineering. Law Enforcement Officers often think that they have no path to transfer out of law enforcement. That simply is not true.</p>
                <p>FCTC is here to help current and former law enforcement learn the skills they need to transfer out of law enforcement. This can be for free without having to get a degree. Often times people who start this path can be hired as a software engineer in 6-12 months. See "FAQ" and "How To Get Started" for more information. Also see below for why software engineering. This website was built by cops who are currently working their way through this program.
