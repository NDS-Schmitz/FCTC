									<p>To begin, navigate to <a href="https://leonnoel.com/100devs/">this</a> discord and join it.</p>
									<p>A few things to keep in mind:									
									</p>
									<ul class="mind-list">
										<li>You may need to verify your account with a phone number. This is hosted through discord, not the discord server. Just used to prevent spam. You are not linking your phone number to anything. You might not have to do this if you're already verified.
										</li>
										<li>The verify option should be at the bottom of your screen.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>	Next, click one of the hearts on the “read first” channel. Select Yellow if you’re a complete coding noob and Green if you have some coding knowledge. Now, click the bell just under the hearts to get stream notifications from Leon and his other teachers. Then go to the channel called “Rules” and click the Green Check mark after reading the rules. Now go to the channel called “Join 100Devs” Click both the green checkmark and the fire icon. Navigate through the channels. You will see HTML//CSS Help, JavaScript, help etc.
									</p>
									<p>
									Finally, go down to “Catch Up Crew” or just click <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1044274193572831313/1044274263307333662/1044383503715946566">here</a>. This is where you can ask questions about catching up and find some other resources. If you click the # in the top right of your screen, you will see a thread called #deleted-channelI highly recommend you open this one to subscribe to it. Feel free to join the #deleted-channel thread as well.

										<a href="https://i.gyazo.com/f54319dd2632cd75372e8b027f5e407f.mp4">This</a> gif will show you the steps. Once you’re comfortable and you set aside some time, go ahead and head over to <a href="https://github.com/labrocadabro/100devs-faq">this</a> link to read over what 100 devs is and some FAQs.
									</p>
									<p>
										Once that's done, head over to <a href="https://100devsfollowalong.netlify.app/">this</a> follow-along app and get started with video #1. I recommend setting time aside for these videos so you can watch them without interruption, however that is not required. Some prefer to watch them at 1.25 speed. Sometimes Leon gets off-track so feel free to skip around as needed. 
									</p>
									<p>
										You can ask any questions you may have in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1044274193572831313/1044274263307333662/1044383503715946566">general-questions</a> channel and feel free to introduce yourself in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1044274193572831313/1044274263307333662/1044383503715946566">intoduce-yourself</a> channel. You can simply state what your end goal is. No one is looking for credit card informaiton or social security numbers. You can simply PM those :)

									<h2>Things to Remember</h2>
									<p>Try not to let yourself get burned out. Learning to code is a large undertaking and there will be times where you feel like giving up. The key is pacing yourself and making sure that you practice the fundamentals several times a week so you retain the information.</p>

									<p>FCTC stands for "From Cops To Coders." This is a resource for current law enforcement officers to have a one-stop resource to start learning skills they can use to leave law enforcement. Coding might be perfect for you because you don't need a degree for it and you can learn the skills needed to become a software engineer in or around 6 months learning it part time.  Group members are verified LEOs.</p>
